=== Preamble

The following code examples will give a rough guideline on how a simple polygon renderer using OpenGL could look like. I will not provide the *complete* code. Copying all the code examples in the following chapters will not result in a functional project.

The full code of the used project can be viewed on the project's https://github.com/Luktronic/OpenGL-Scientific-Paper[GitHub repository] cite:[PaperRepo].

For additional resources, look at <<References>> and <<Additional Sources & Information>>.

=== Setup

In this showcase I will implement a simple rendering example using OpenGL in C++. As the windowing system I will use https://www.glfw.org/[GLFW] as well as https://glad.dav1d.de/[Glad] for loading the OpenGL functions.

GLFW cite:[glfwsite] can be cloned from its https://github.com/glfw/glfw[GitHub repository] cite:[glfwrepo] and then be included in your project.

Glad can be downloaded from https://glad.dav1d.de/[this] cite:[Glad] site. It can then be included manually in the project.

I will not go into detail how to include libraries in C++.

****
The website https://learnopengl.com/[learnopengl.com] has an https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window[in-depth guide] cite:[LearnOpenGl] about how to set up a project using the same libraries.

=== Creating a window

At first, I created my own `Window` class, which should help us with managing our Window. In this class I created a function which creates a GLFW Window.

Using this class, I am creating a new GLFW window and setting it up properly.

=== Setting up the Renderer

Now that the window setup is complete, I can start creating a simple renderer which renders a polygon.

==== Creating the Vertices

At first, I need to define the vertices of the polygon that I want to render. 

.Defining the vertices
[source, c++, indent=0]
----
include::../../../project/OpenGLPaper/src/Renderer.cpp[tag=vertices]
----

Here I defined the vertex coordinates (represented as x, y, z). The range of the coordinates goes from ``-1.0`` to ``1.0``, ``-1.0`` being the far left of the window and ``1.0`` being the far right. The 3 vertices I defined would create a polygon in the middle of the screen.


Next, I create a **vertex buffer object**. The VBO is the object that contains our vertex data and gets bound to OpenGL

.Creating the Vertex Buffer Object

----
include::../../../project/OpenGLPaper/src/Renderer.cpp[tag=vbo]
----

Lastly, I create a **vertex array object**, which is an array that contains VBOs and sends them to OpenGL.

----
include::../../../project/OpenGLPaper/src/Renderer.cpp[tag=vao]
----

==== Creating the Shaders

At first, I write a valid vertex shader in the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL).

.Vertex Shader Code
[source, hlsl, indent=0]
----
#version 460 core
layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;

void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(aPos.x, aPos.y, aPos.z, 1.0);
}
----

Then I pass the shader source code as a string to OpenGL.

.Passing the Vertex Shader to OpenGL
[source, c++, indent=0]
----
include::../../../project/OpenGLPaper/src/Renderer.cpp[tag=setupvertex]
----

Then I repeat the same thing for the following Fragment Shader:

.Fragment Shader Code
[source, hlsl indent=0]
----
#version 460 core
out vec4 FragColor;

void main()
{
    FragColor = vec4(1.0f, 0.5f, 0.2f, 1.0f);
} 
----

In the end, I create the Shader Program that contains all the used shaders and gets linked by OpenGL.

.Creating and linking the Shader Program
[source, c++, indent=0]
----
include::../../../project/OpenGLPaper/src/Renderer.cpp[tag=shaderprogram]
----

=== Rendering Loop

At last, I implement a while loop that keeps rendering the polygon until the window is closed.

.Render loop
[source, c++, indent=0]
----
include::../../../project/OpenGLPaper/src/Application.cpp[tag=renderloop]
----

With `glClearColor()` I set the "base" color of the rendered image (the colour that OpenGL draws when the pixel is not part of any other render object).

With `glSwapBuffers()`, I switch the front and back buffers of the image. This means that the last image of the window will get replaced by the newly rendered one.

=== Result

When running the project now, a window opens with the following render:
