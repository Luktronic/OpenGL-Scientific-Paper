=== Setup

In this example I will implement a simple rendering example using OpenGL in C++. As the windowing system I will use https://www.glfw.org/[GLFW] footnote:[https://www.glfw.org/], as well as https://glad.dav1d.de/[Glad] for loading the OpenGL functions.

GLFW can be cloned from its https://github.com/glfw/glfw[GitHub repository] footnote:[https://github.com/glfw/glfw] and then be included in your project.

Glad can be downloaded from https://glad.dav1d.de/[this] footnote:[https://glad.dav1d.de/] site. It can then be included manually in the project.

I will not go into detail how to include libraries in C++.

****
The website https://learnopengl.com/[learnopengl.com] has a an https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window[in-depth guide] footnote:[https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window] about how to set up a project using the same libraries.

==== Creating a window

At first, I created my own `Window` class, which should help us with managing our Window. In this class I created a function which creates a GLFW Window.

.createWindow() function
